# First_Indicator
<<<<<<< HEAD
My first python indicator for trading

First indicator with metatrader 5 and python. This indicator uses fractals, trendlines, and fib retracement. The indicator will draw a trendline from one fractal to the other. Then it will draw a trendline from each bar between the two fractals to the second fractal. If the slope of the bar to the second fractal breaks the slope from the first fractal to the second fractal, then that trendline is not valid.
